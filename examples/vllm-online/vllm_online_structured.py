"""Generate synthetic recipes for different cuisines using vLLM online API with structured output.

This script demonstrates using vLLM backend with curator to generate structured recipe data for various
world cuisines in an efficient batched manner. It uses the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model and expects
responses in a structured format defined by Pydantic models.

To start the vLLM server, run the following command:
vllm serve

--host localhost
--port 8787
